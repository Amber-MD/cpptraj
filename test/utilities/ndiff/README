This directory contains a utility, ndiff, for comparing putatively
similar files, ignoring small numeric differences.

See "man ndiff" for program documentation.

That documentation is also provided with the distribution in HTML,
Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF), PostScript, and ASCII
text formats, all automatically derived from the original source file
in nroff/troff markup, ndiff.man,

See the companion INSTALL file for installation instructions.
