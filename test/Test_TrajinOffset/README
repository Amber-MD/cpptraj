DRR - 2010-03-17
Tested: COORD_AMBER_REMD in and out, gzip/bzip in, trajin with offsets

This tests ptraj's ability to read in compressed and uncompressed trajectories
with offsets, diff is based on output coordinates. Input and output is in Amber 
REMD trajectory format, but processed without the remdtraj flag.
