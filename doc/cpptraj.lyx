\begin_layout Standard

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 (the successor to 
\emph on
ptraj
\emph default
) is the main program in Amber for processing coordinate trajectories and
 data files.
 
\shape italic
Cpptraj
\shape default
 has a wide range of functionality, and makes use of OpenMP/MPI to speed
 up many calculations, including processing ensembles of trajectories and/or
 conducting multiple analyses in parallel with MPI.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here are several notable features of 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Trajectories with different topologies can be processed in the same run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Several actions/analyses in 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 are OpenMP parallelized; see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:CpptrajOpenMP"

\end_inset

 for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Trajectory and ensemble reads can be MPI parallelized.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Almost any file read or written by 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 can be compressed (with the exception of the NetCDF trajectory format).
 So for example gzipped/bzipped topology files can be read, and data files
 can be written out as gzip/bzip2 files.
 Compression is detected automatically when reading, and is determined by
 the filename extension (.gz and .bz2 respectively) on writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The format of output data files can be specified by extension.
 For example, data files can be written in xmgrace format if the filename
 given has a '.agr' extension.
 A trajectory can be written in DCD format if the '.dcd' extension is used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multiple output trajectories can be specified, and can be written during
 action processing (as opposed to only after) via the 
\series bold
\shape italic
outtraj
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 In addition, output files can be directed to write only specific frames
 from the input trajectories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Multiple reference structures can be specified.
 Specific frames from trajectories may be used as a reference structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The 
\series bold
\shape italic
rmsd
\series default
\shape default
 action allows specification of a separate mask for the reference structure.
 In addition, per-residue RMSD can be calculated easily.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Actions that modify coordinates and topology such as the 
\series bold
\shape italic
strip
\series default
\shape default
/
\series bold
\shape italic
closest
\series default
\shape default
 actions can often write an accompanying fully-functional stripped topology
 file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Users usually are able to fine-tune the output format of data files declared
 in actions using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold
out
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keyword (for example, the precision of the numbers can be changed).
 In addition, users can control which data sets are written to which files
 (e.g.
 if two actions specify the same data file with the 'out' keyword, data
 from both actions will be written to that data file).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Users can manipulate data sets using mathematical expressions (with some
 limitations), see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj-Data-Set-Math"

\end_inset

 for details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
There is some support for creating internal loops over e.g.
 mask expressions and setting internal variables (see 
\series bold

\begin_layout Standard
Note that unlike 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
, in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 it is not required that a topology file be specified on the command line
 as long as one is specified in the input file with the 'parm' keyword.
 Multiple topology/input files can be specified by use of multiple '-p'
 and '-i' flags.
 All topology and coordinate flags will be processed before any input flags.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Commands
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Input to 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 is in the form of commands, which can be categorized in to 2 types: immediate
 and queued.
 Immediate commands are executed as soon as they are encountered.
 Queued commands are initialized when they are encountered, but are not
 executed until a Run is executed via a 
\series bold
\shape italic
run
\series default
\shape default
 or 
\series bold
\shape italic
go
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 Actions, Analyses, and Trajectory commands (except 
\series bold
\emph on
reference
\series default
\emph default
) are queued commands; however, they can also be run immediately via commands
 such as 
\series bold
\shape italic
crdaction
\series default
,
\shape default
 
\series bold
\shape italic
runanalysis
\series default
,
\shape default
 
\series bold
\emph on
loadcrd
\series default
\emph default
, etc.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Coordinates-as-a"

\end_inset

 for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands fall into seven categories:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
General (Immediate) These commands are executed immediately when entered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
System (Immediate) These are unix system commands (e.g.
 'ls', 'pwd', etc).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Coords (Immediate) These commands are used to manipulate COORDS data sets;
 see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Coordinates-as-a"

\end_inset

 for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Trajectory (Queued) These commands prepare cpptraj for reading or writing
 trajectories during a Run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Topology (Immediate) These commands are used to read, write, and modify
 topology information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Action (Queued) These commands specify actions that will be performed on
 coordinate frames read in from trajectories during a Run.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Analysis (Queued) These commands specify analyses that will be performed
 on data that has been either generated from a Run or read in from an external
 source.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Control (Immediate) These commands set up control blocks that can be used
 to e.g.
 loop over a set of commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to normal commands, 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 now has the ability to perform certain basic math operations, even on data
 sets.
 See 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj-Data-Set-Math"

\end_inset

 for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Commands in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 can be read in from an input file or from the interactive command prompt.
 A '#' anywhere on a line denotes a comment; anything after '#' will be
 ignored no matter where it occurs.
 A '
\backslash
' allows the continuation of one line to another.
 For example, the input:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
# Sample input
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin mdcrd # This is a trajectory
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms first out rmsd.dat 
\backslash

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
    :1-10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translates to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin mdcrd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms first out rmsd.dat :1-10
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Getting Help
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If in interactive mode, 'help <command>' can be used to get the associated
 keywords as well as an abbreviated description of the command.
 Most commands have a corresponding test which also serves as an example
 of how to use the command.
 See $AMBERHOME/AmberTools/test/cpptraj/README for more details.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Batch mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

batch
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 mode, cpptraj is executed from the command line with one or more input
 files containing commands to be processed or STDIN.
 The syntax of <input file> is similar to that of 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
.
 Keywords specifying different commands are given one per line.
 Lines beginning with '#' are ignored as comments.
 Lines can also be continued through use of the '
\backslash
' character.
 This is the only allowed mode for cpptraj.MPI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Interactive mode
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

interactive mode
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 users can enter commands in a UNIX-like shell.
 Interactive mode is useful for running short and simple analyses or for
 trying out new kinds of analyses.
 If 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 is run with '–interactive', no arguments, or no specified input file:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cpptraj
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cpptraj --interactive
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cpptraj <parm file>
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cpptraj -p <parm file>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
this brings up the interactive interface.
 This interface supports command history (via the up and down arrows) and
 tab completion for commands and file names.
 If no log file name has been given (with '–log <logfile>'), all commands
 used in interactive mode will be logged to a file named 'cpptraj.log', which
 can subsequently be used as input if desired.
 When starting cpptraj, command histories will be read from any existing
 logs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Trajectory Processing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Like 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
, a trajectory processing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is one of the main ways to run 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
.
 First the Run is set up via commands read in from an input file or the
 interactive prompt.
 Trajectories are then read in one frame at a time (or in the case of ensemble
 processing all frames from a given step are read).
 Actions are performed on the coordinates stored in the frame, after which
 any output coordinates are written.
 At the end of the run, any data sets generated are written, and any queued
 Analyses are performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Actions and multiple topologies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 supports multiple topology files, during a Run actions are set up every
 time the topology changes in order to recalculate things like what atoms
 are in a mask etc.
 Actions that are not valid for the current topology are skipped for that
 topology.
 So for example given two topology files with 100 residues, if the first
 topology file processed includes a ligand named MOL and the second one
 does not, the action:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance :80 :MOL out D_80-to-MOL.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will be valid for the first topology but not for the second, so it will
 be skipped as long as the second topology is active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parallelization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Cpptraj
\emph default
 has many levels of parallelization that can be enabled via the '-mpi',
 '-openmp', and/or '-cuda' configure flags for MPI, OpenMP, and CUDA paralleliza
tion respectively.
 At the highest level, trajectory and ensemble reads are parallelized with
 MPI.
 In addition, certain time consuming actions have been parallelized with
 OpenMP and/or CUDA.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that any combination of the '-openmp', '-cuda', and '-mpi' flags may
 be used to generate a hybrid MPI/OpenMP/CUDA binary; however this may require
 additional runtime setup (e.g.
 setting OMP_NUM_THREADS for OpenMP) to work properly and not oversubscribe
 cores.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
MPI Trajectory Parallelization
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:CpptrajMPI"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
Cpptraj
\shape default
 has two levels of MPI parallelization for reading input trajectories.
 The first is for '
\series bold
\emph on
trajin
\series default
\emph default
' trajectory input, where the trajectory read is divided as evenly as possible
 among all input frames.
 For example, if given two trajectories of 1000 frames each and 4 MPI threads,
 thread 0 reads frames 1-500 of trajectory 1, thread 1 reads frames 501-1000
 of trajectory 1, thread 2 reads frames 1-500 of trajectory 2, and thread
 3 reads frames 501-1000 of trajectory 2.
 Most Actions will work with across-trajectory parallelization with the
 exception of the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
'clusterdihedral', 'contacts', 'createreservoir', 'gist', 'lipidorder',
 'pairwise', 'stfcdiffusion', 'unwrap', and 'xtalsymm'.
 Note that 'diffusion' will only work with across-trajectory parallelism
 if no imaging is to be performed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\shape italic
\emph on
The second is for 
\series bold
\emph default
'ensemble'
\series default
\shape default
 trajectory input, where the reading/processing/writing of each member of
 the ensemble is divided up among MPI threads.
 The number of MPI threads must be a multiple of the ensemble size.
 If the number of threads is greater than the ensemble size then the processing
 of each ensemble member will be divided among MPI threads.
 For example, given an ensemble of 4 trajectories and 8 threads, threads
 0 and 1 are assigned to the first ensemble trajectory, threads 2 and 3
 are assigned to the second ensemble trajectory, and so on.
 When using ensemble mode in parallel it is recommended that the 
\series bold
\emph on
ensemblesize
\series default
\emph default
 command be used prior to any ensemble command as this will make set up
 far more efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the MPI version, Amber/
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 should be configured with the '-mpi' flag.
 You can tell if 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 has been compiled with MPI as it will print 'MPI' in the title, and/or
 by calling 'cpptraj —defines' and looking for '-DMPI'.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the more time-consuming actions/analyses in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 have been parallelized with OpenMP to take advantage of machines with multiple
 cores.
 In order to use OpenMP parallelization Amber/
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 should be configured with the '-openmp' flag.
 You can easily tell if 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 has been compiled with OpenMP as it will print 'OpenMP' in the title, and/or
 by calling 'cpptraj —defines' and looking for '-D_OPENMP'.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CUDA Parallelization
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some time-consuming actions in cpptraj have been parallelized with CUDA
 to take advantage of machines with NVIDIA GPUs.
 In order to use CUDA parallelization Amber/cpptraj should be configured
 with the '-cuda' flag.
 You can easily tell if cpptraj has been compiled with CUDA as it will print
 'CUDA' and details on the current graphics device in the title, and/or
 by calling 'cpptraj —defines' and looking for '-DCUDA'.
 The following actions have been CUDA parallelized:

\begin_layout Subsection
Atom Mask Selection Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mask syntax is similar to 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
.
 Note that the characters '
\family typewriter
:
\family default
', '
\family typewriter
@
\family default
', and '
\family typewriter
*
\family default
' are reserved for masks and should not be used in output file or data set
 names.
 All masks are case-sensitive.
 Either names or numbers can be used.
 Masks can contain ranges (denoted with '
\family typewriter
-
\family default
') and comma separated lists.
 The logical operands '
\family typewriter
&
\family default
' (and), '
\family typewriter
|
\family default
' (or), and '
\family typewriter
!
\family default
' (not) are also supported.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax for elementary selections is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
@{atom
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

numlist} e.g.
 '@12,17', '@54-85', '@12,54-85,90'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
@{atom
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

namelist} e.g.
 '@CA', '@CA,C,O,N,H'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
@%{atom
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

type
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

name} e.g.
 '@%CT'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
@/{atom_element_name} e.g.
 '@/N'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:{residue
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

numlist} e.g.
 ':1-10', ':1,3,5', ':1-3,5,7-9'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:{residue
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

namelist} e.g.
 ':LYS', ':ARG,ALA,GLY'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:/{chain
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

id} e.g.
 ':/B', ':/A,D'.
 Requires chain ID information be present in the topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:;{pdb
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

residue
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

number} e.g.
 ':;2-4,8'.
 Requires a PDB loaded as topology, or Amber topology with embedded PDB
 information (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:parmed_addPDB"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
^{molecule
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

numlist} e.g.
 '^1-10', ':23,84,111'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
<mask><distance
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

op><distance> Selection by distance, see below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several wildcard characters are supported:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
'*' Zero or more characters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
'=' Same as '*'
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
'?' One character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The wildcards can also be used with numbers or other mask characters, e.g.
 ':?0' means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

:10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, ':*' means all residues and '@*' means all atoms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compound expressions of the following type are allowed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
:{residue numlist | namelist}@{atom namelist | numlist}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and are processed as: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
:{residue numlist | namelist} & @{atom namelist | numlist}
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
e.g.
 ':1-10@CA' is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

:1-10 & @CA
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More examples: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:ALA,TRP All alanine and tryptophan residues.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:5,10@CA CA carbon in residues 5 and 10.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:*&!@H= All non-hydrogen atoms (equivalent to "!@H=").
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
@CA,C,O,N,H All backbone atoms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
!@CA,C,O,N,H All non-backbone atoms (=sidechains for proteins only).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:1-500@O&!(:WAT|:LYS,ARG) All backbone oxygens in residues 1-500 but not
 in water, lysine or arginine residues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
^1-2:ASP All residues named 'ASP' in the first two molecules.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
:/A,D@CA All atoms named 'CA' in chains A and D.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Distance-based Masks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two very important things to keep in mind when using distance
 based masks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Distance-based masks that update each frame are currently only supported
 by the 
\series bold
\shape italic
mask
\series default
\shape default
 action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Selection by distance for everything but the 
\series bold
\shape italic
mask
\series default
\shape default
 action requires defining a reference frame with 
\series bold
\shape italic
reference
\series default
\shape default
; distances are then calculated using the 
\bar under
specified reference frame only
\bar default
.
 This reference frame can be changed using the 
\series bold
\emph on
activeref
\series default
\emph default
 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The syntax for selection by distance is a 
\series bold
<mask>
\series default
 expression followed by a 
\series bold
<distance operator>
\series default
 followed by a 
\series bold
<distance>
\series default
 (which is in Angstroms).
 The 
\series bold
<distance operator>
\series default
 consists of 2 characters: '
\series bold
<
\series default
' (within) or '
\series bold
>
\series default
' (without) followed by either '
\series bold
^
\series default
' (molecules), '
\series bold
:
\series default
' (residues), or '
\series bold
@
\series default
' (atoms).
 For example, '
\series bold
<:
\series default
3.0' means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

residues within 3.0 Angstroms
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 etc.
 For residue- and molecule-based distance selection, if any atom in that
 residue/molecule matches the given distance criterion, the entire residue/molec
ule is selected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In plain language, the entire distance mask can be read as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select 
\series bold
<distance operator>
\series default
 
\series bold
<distance>
\series default
 of 
\series bold
<mask>
\series default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So for example, the mask expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
:11-17<@2.4
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Means 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Select atoms within 2.4 Å distance of atoms selected by ':11-17' (residues
 numbered 11 through 17)
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To strip everything outside 3.0 Å (i.e.
 without 3.0 Å) from residue 4 using specified reference coordinates:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
reference mol.rst7
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin mol.rst7
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
strip !(:4<:3.0)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Ranges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For several commands some arguments are ranges (e.g.
 'trajout onlyframes <range>', 'nastruct resrange <range>', 'rmsd perres
 range <range>'); 
\series bold
THESE ARE NOT ATOM MASKS
\series default
.
 They are simple number ranges using '-' to specify a range and ',' to separate
 different ranges.
 For example 1-2,4-6,9 specifies 1 to 2, 4 to 6, and 9, i.e.
 '1 2 4 5 6 9'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter/Reference Tagging
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:Parameter/Reference-Tagging"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Parameter and reference files may be 'tagged' (i.e.
 given a nickname); these tags can then be used in place of the file name
 itself.
 A tag in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 is recognized by being bounded by brackets ('[' and ']').
 This can be particularly useful when reading in many parameter or reference
 files.
 For example, when reading in multiple reference structures:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin Test1.crd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
reference 1LE1.NoWater.Xray.rst7 [xray]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
reference Test1.crd lastframe [last]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
reference Test2.crd 225 [open]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms Xray ref [xray] :2-12@CA out rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms Last ref [last] :2-12@CA out rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms Open ref [open] :2-12@CA out rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This defines three reference structures and gives them tags [xray], [last],
 and [open].
 These reference structures can then be referred to by their tags instead
 of their filenames by any action that uses reference structures (in this
 case the RMSD action).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, this can be useful when reading in multiple parameter files:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
parm tz2.ff99sb.tip3p.truncoct.parm7 [tz2-water]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
parm tz2.ff99sb.mbondi2.parm7 [tz2-nowater]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin tz2.run1.explicit.nc parm [tz2-water]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
reference tz2.dry.rst7 parm [tz2-nowater] [tz2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms ref [tz2] !(:WAT) out rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This defines two parm files and gives them tags [tz2-water] and [tz2-nowater],
 then reads in a trajectory associated with one, and a reference structure
 associated with the other.
 Note that in the 'reference' command there are two tags; the first goes
 along with the 'parm' keyword and specifies what parameter file the reference
 should use, the second is the tag given to the reference itself (as in
 the previous example) and is referred to in the subsequent RMSD action.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Variables and Control Structures
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As of version 18, CPPTRAJ has limited support for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

script
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 variables and 'for' loops.
 Script variables are referred to by a dollar sign ('$') prefix and are
 replaced when they are processed.
 Note that to use script variables in CPPTRAJ input that is also inside
 e.g.
 a BASH script, they can be escaped with the '
\backslash
' character, e.g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#!/bin/bash
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
TOP=MyTop.parm7
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cpptraj <<EOF
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
set topname=$TOP
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
parm 
\backslash
$topname
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
EOF
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that regular CPPTRAJ 1D Data Sets that contain a single value can be
 used as script variables (if the Data Set contains more than 1 value only
 the first value will be used).

\begin_layout Standard
Create a for loop using one or more mask expressions or integers.
 Loops can be nested, but currently inner loops cannot refer to output loop
 variables.
 Integer loops may be used without an end condition, but in that case at
 least one descriptor in the loop should have an end condition or refer
 to a mask.
 Loops are ended by the 
\series bold
done
\series default
 keyword.
 Note that unlike C-style for loops the variable is not incremented on the
 final execution, so the final value of 
\series bold
<var>
\series default
 will be 
\series bold
<end>
\series default
 (or the last selection in the mask).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
for atoms A0 inmask :1-3@CA i=1;i++
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
  distance d$i :TCS $A0 out $i.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
done
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This loops over all atoms in the mask expression ':1-3@CA' (all atoms named
 CA in residues 1 to 3) and creates a variable named 'i' that starts from
 1 and is incremented by 1 each iteration.
 Inside the loop, the mask selection is referred to by 
\series bold
$A0
\series default
 and the integer by 
\series bold
$i
\series default
.
 This is equivalent to doing 3 distance commands like so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance d1 :TCS :1@CA out 1.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance d2 :TCS :2@CA out 2.dat

Data Sets and Data Files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
, Actions and Analyses can generate one or more data sets which are available
 for further processing.
 For example, the 
\series bold
\shape italic
distance
\series default
\shape default
 command creates a data set containing distances vs time.
 The data set can be named by the user simply by specifying a non-keyword
 string as an additional argument.
 If no name is given, a default one will be generated based on the action
 name and data set number.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance d1-2 :1 :2 out d1-2.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will create a data set named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

d1-2
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If a name is not specified, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance :1 :2 out d1-2.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the data set will be named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Dis_00000
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data files are created automatically by most commands, usually via the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\series bold

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keyword.
 Data files can also be explicitly created with the 
\series bold
\shape italic
write
\shape default
/
\shape italic
writedata
\series default
\shape default
 and 
\series bold
\shape italic
create
\series default

 commands.
 Data can also be read in from files via the

readdata
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 Cpptraj currently recognizes the formats listed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:cpptraj-DataFile-formats"

\end_inset

, although it cannot write in all formats.
 In addition, a data set must be valid for the data file format.
 For example, 3D data (such as a grid) can be written to an OpenDX format
 file but not a Grace format file.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The default file format is called 'Standard', which simply has data in columns,
 like 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
, although multiple data sets can be directed to the same output file.
 The format of a file can be changed either by specifying a recognized keyword
 (either on the command line itself or later via a 'datafile' command) or
 by giving the file an extension corresponding to te format, so 'filename.agr'
 will output in Grace format, and 'filename.gnu' will output in Gnuplot contour,
 and so on.
 The xmgrace/gnuplot output is particularly nice for the secstruct sumout
 and rmsd perresout files.
 Additional options for data files can be found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Datafile-Commands"

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Any action using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

out
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 keyword will allow data sets from separate commands to be written into
 the same file.
 For example, the commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dihedral phi :1@C :2@N :2@CA :2@C out phipsi.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
dihedral psi :2@N :2@CA :2@C :3@N out phipsi.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
will assign the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

psi
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data sets generated from each action to the standard data output file 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

phipsi.dat
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

:

Data Set Selection Syntax
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many analysis commands can be used to analyze multiple data sets.
 The general format for selecting data sets is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<name>[<aspect>]:<index>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The '*' character can be used as a wild-card for 
\shape italic
entire
\shape default
 names (no partial matches).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
<name>:
\series default
 The data set name, usually specified in the action (e.g.
 in 'distance d0 @1 @2' the data set name is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

d0
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
<aspect>:
\series default
 Optional; this is set for certain data sets internally in order to easily
 select subsets of data.
 
\series bold
The brackets are required
\series default
.
 For example, when using 'hbond series', both solute-solute and solute-solvent
 hydrogen bond time series may be generated.
 To select all solute-solute hydrogen bonds one would use the aspect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[solutehb]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

; to select solute-solvent hydrogen bonds the aspect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[solventhb]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would be used.
 Aspects are hard-coded and are listed in the commands that use them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\series bold
<index>:
\series default
 Optional; for actions that generate many data sets (such as 'rmsd perres')
 an index is used.
 Depending on the action, the index may correspond to atom #s, residue #s,
 etc.
 A number range (comma and/or dash separated) may be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example: to select all data sets with aspect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[shear]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 named NA_00000:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
NA_00000[shear]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To select all data sets with aspect 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[stagger]
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with any name, indices 1 and 3:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
*[stagger]:1,3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In ensemble mode, data set selection has additional syntax:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<name>[<aspect>]:<index>%<member>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where <member> is the ensemble member number starting from 0.

\begin_layout Standard
Numbers can be expressed in scientific notation using 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

E
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 notation, e.g.
 1E-5 = 0.00001.
 The parser also recognizes PI as the number pi.
 Expressions can also be enclosed in parentheses.
 So for example, the following expression is valid:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
> 1 - ln(sin(PI/4) * 2)^2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Result: 0.879887
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Results of numerical calculations like the above can be assigned to a variable
 (essentially a data set of size 1) for use in subsequent calculations,
 e.g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
> R = 1 - ln(sin(PI/4) * 2)^2 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Result stored in 'R' 
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
> R + 1 Result: 1.879887
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data sets can be specified in expressions as well.
 Currently data sets in an expression must be of the same type and only
 1D, 2D, and 3D data sets are supported.
 Functions are applied to each member of the data set.
 So for example, given two 1D data sets of the same size named D0 and D1,
 the following expression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
> D2 = sqrt( D0 ) + D1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
would take the square root of each member of D0, add it to the corresponding
 member of D1, and assign the result to D2.
 The following table lists which operations are valid for data set types.
 If a type is not listed it is not supported:

 If indices are present they will be skipped.
 Assume first 3 columns after the index volumn are vector X, Y, and Z, and
 (if present) the next 3 columns contain vector origin X, Y, and Z.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
mat3x3 Read data as 3x3 matrix.
 If indices are present they will be skipped.
 Assume matrices are in row major order on each line, i.e.
 M(1,1) M(1,2) ...
 M(3,2) M(3,3).
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
By default, standard data files are assumed to contain 1D data in columns.
 Data set legends will be read in if the file has a header line (denoted
 by '#').
 Columns labeled '#Frame' are automatically considered the 'index' column
 and skipped.
 Data sets are stored as <name>:<idx> where <name> is the given data set
 name (the file name if not specified) and <idx> corresponds to the column
 the data was read from starting from 1.
 
\shape italic
Cpptraj
\shape default
 assumes the data increases monotonically and will automatically attempt
 to determine the dimensions of the data set(s); a warning will be printed
 if this is not successful.

Coordinates (COORDS) Data Set Commands

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Coordinate I/O tends to be the most time-consuming part of trajectory analysis.
 In addition, many types of analyses (for example two-dimensional RMSD and
 cluster analysis) require using coordinate frames multiple times.
 To simplify this, trajectory coordinates may be saved as a separate data
 set via the 
\series bold
\shape italic
loadcrd
\series default
\shape default
 command or 
\series bold
\shape italic
createcrd
\series default
\shape default
 action.
 Any action can then be performed on the COORDS data set with the 
\series bold
\shape italic
crdaction
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 The 
\series bold
\shape italic
crdout
\series default
\shape default
 command can be used to write coordinates to an output trajectory (similar
 to 
\series bold
\shape italic
trajout
\series default
\shape default
).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although COORDS data sets store everything internally with single-precision,
 they can still use a large amount of memory.
 Because of this there is a specialized type of COORDS data set called a
 TRAJ data set (trajectory), which functions exactly like a COORDS data
 set except all data is stored on disk.
 TRAJ data sets can be created with the 
\series bold
\shape italic
loadtraj
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 
\emph on
TRAJ data sets cannot be modified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several analyses that can be performed using COORDS data sets,
 either as part of the normal analysis list or via the 
\series bold
\shape italic
runanalysis
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 Note that while these analyses can be run on specified COORDS data sets,
 if one is not specified a default COORDS data set will be created, made
 up of frames from 
\series bold
\shape italic
trajin
\series default
\shape default
 commands.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an example of where this might be useful is in the calculation of atomic
 positional fluctuations.
 Previously this required two steps: one to generate an average structure,
 then a second to rms-fit to that average structure prior to calculating
 the fluctuations.
 This can now be done in one pass with the following input:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
loadcrd mdcrd.nc
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
Either set the legend for a single data set, create a new set with X values
 from one set and Y values from another, concatenate 2 or more sets, make
 a 2D set from 1D set, remove sets according to a certain criterion, or
 change the mode/type for one or more data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Setting the mode/type can be useful for cases where the data set is being
 read in from a file; for example when reading in a dihedral data set the
 type can be set to 'dihedral' so that various Analysis routines like 
\series bold
\shape italic
statistics
\series default
\shape default
 know to treat it as periodic.

.
 If the file does not contain bond information, cpptraj will attempt to
 assign bonds based on a simple distance search of atoms within and between
 residues.
 The distance cutoff for determining bonds between atoms depends on the
 elements of the two atoms in question, augmented by <offset>.
 Molecule information is then determined from bond information.

IMPORTANT NOTES FOR PDB FILES
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some older format PDB files (before version 3), certain atoms may contain
 the asterisk ('*') character in their name (e.g.
 'C1*' in a nucleic acid backbone).
 Since in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 the asterisk is a reserved character for atom masks all asterisks in PDB
 atom names are replaced with single quote (') to avoid issues with the
 mask parser.
 So in a structure with an atom named C1*, to select it use the mask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

@C1'
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes PDB files can contain alternate coordinates for the same atom
 in a residue, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 will print a warning about duplicate atom names but will take no other
 action.
 Both residues are considered 'CYS' and the mask ':CYS@CA' would select
 both atom 806 and 809.
 Residue insertion codes are read in but also not used by the mask parser.

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajout temp.crd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
distance d1 out d1.ensemble.dat @1 @21
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will output 4 temperature trajectories named 'temp.crd.X', where X ranges
 from 0 to 3 with 0 corresponding to the lowest temperature, and 'd1.ensemble.dat'
 containing 4 columns, each corresponding to a temperature.
 If run with MPI, data will be written to separate files named 'd1.ensemble.dat.X',
 similar to the output trajectories.

 If desired, an atom mask can be used to read in only specified atoms from
 a reference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Reference coordinates are now considered COORDS data sets and can be used
 anywhere a COORDS data set could, which allows reference structures to
 be manipulated once they are loaded.
 For example, a reference structure could be centered on the origin like
 so:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
crdaction [MyRef] center origin

 To read in a trajectory with offsets where the last frame # is not known,
 specify the 
\series bold

 keyword instead of a <stop> argument, e.g.
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin Test1.crd 10 last 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This will process Test1.crd from frame 10 to the last frame, skipping by
 2 frames.
 To explicitly select only the last frame, specify the 
\series bold
lastframe
\series default

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
parm top1.parm7
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin Test2.crd parm [top2]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin Test3.crd parmindex 3
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Test0.crd is associated with top0.parm7; since no parm was specified it defaulted
 to the first parm read in.
 Test1.crd was associated with top1.parm7 by filename, Test2.crd was associated
 with top2.parm7 by its tag, and finally Test3.crd was associated with top3.parm7
 by its index (based on the order it was read in).
\end_layout

Replica Trajectory Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the 
\series bold
remdtraj
\series default
 keyword is specified the trajectory is treated as belonging to the lowest
 # replica of a group of REMD trajectories.
 The remaining replicas can be either automatically detected by following
 a naming convention of <REMDFILENAME>.X, where X is the replica number,
 or explicitly specified in a comma-separated list following the 
\series bold
trajnames
\series default
 keyword.
 All trajectories will be processed at the same time, but only frames with
 a temperature matching the one specified by 
\series bold
remdtrajtemp
\series default
 or 
\series bold
remdtrajidx
\series default
 will be processed.
 For example, to process replica trajectories rem.001, rem.002, rem.003, and
 rem.004, grabbing only the frames at temperature 300.0 (assuming that this
 is a temperature in the ensemble):
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

or
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Actions in 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 operate on frames read in by the 
\series bold
\emph on
trajin
\series default
\emph default
 or 
\series bold
\emph on
ensemble
\series default
\emph default
 commands one at a time and extract derived data, modify the coordinates/topolog
y in some way, or both.
 Most Actions in 
\shape italic
cpptraj
\shape default
 function exactly the way they do in 
\shape italic
ptraj
\shape default
 and are backwards-compatible.
 Some Action commands in 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 have extra functionality compared to 
\emph on
ptraj
\emph default
 (such as the per-residue RMSD function of the 
\series bold
\emph on
rmsd
\series default
\emph default
 Action, or the ability to write out stripped topologies for visualization
 in the 
\series bold
\emph on
strip
\series default
\emph default
 Action), while other Actions produce slightly different output (like the
 
\series bold
\emph on
hbond
\series default
\emph default
/
\series bold
\emph on
secstruct
\series default
\emph default
 Actions).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike some other command types, when an Action command is issued it is
 by default added to the Action queue and is not executed until trajectory
 processing is started (e.g.
 by a 
\series bold
\emph on
run
\series default
\emph default
 or 
\series bold
\emph on
go
\series default
\emph default
 command).
 However, Actions can be executed immediately on COORDS data sets via the
 
\series bold
\emph on
crdaction
\series default
\emph default
 command (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj_crdaction"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a frame is modified by an Action, it is modified for every Action that
 follows them during trajectory processing.
 For example, given a solvated system with water residues named WAT and
 the following Action commands:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rmsd R1 first :WAT out water-rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
strip :WAT
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rmsd R2 first :WAT out water-rmsd-2.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
the first 
\series bold
\emph on
rms
\series default
\emph default
 command will be valid, but the second 
\series bold
\emph on
rms
\series default
\emph default
 command will not since all residues named WAT are removed from the state
 by the 
\series bold
\emph on
strip
\series default
\emph default
 command.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that for commands which can use a reference mask as well as a target
 mask (e.g.
 
\series bold
\emph on
rms
\series default
\emph default
, 
\series bold
\emph on
drmsd
\series default
\emph default
, 
\series bold
\emph on
symmrmsd
\series default
\emph default
, etc.) there must be a 1 to 1 correspondence between the atoms in each mask,
 i.e.
 the 
\emph on
number of atoms and the ordering of selected atoms must be the same
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following Actions are available.
 If an Action may modify coordinate/topology information for subsequent
 Actions it is denoted with an X in the 
\family typewriter
\series bold
Mod
\family default
\series default
 column.

\begin_layout Standard
Attempt to map the atoms of <target> to those of <reference> based on structural
 similarity.
 This is useful e.g.
 when there are two files containing the same structure but with different
 atom names or atom ordering.
 Both <target> and <reference> need to have been read in with a previous
 
\series bold
\shape italic
reference
\series default
\shape default
 command.
 The state will then be modified so that any trajectory read in with the
 same parameter file as <target> will have its atoms mapped (i.e.
 reordered) to match those of <reference>.
 If the number of atoms that can be mapped in <target> are less than those
 in <reference>, the reference structure specified by <reference> will be
 modified to include only mapped atoms; this is useful if for example the
 reference structure is protonated with respect to the target.
 The 
\series bold
rmsfit
\series default
 keyword is useful in cases where the atom mapping will not be complete
 (e.g.
 two ligands with the same scaffold but different substituents).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, say you have the same ligand structure in two files, Ref.mol2
 and Lig.mol2, but the atom ordering in each file is different.

 same ordering as Ref.mol2:

\begin_layout Standard
Automatically center and image (by molecule) a trajectory with periodic

 For most cases just specifying 
\series bold
\shape italic
'autoimage'
\series default
\shape default
 alone is sufficient.
 The atoms of the 
\series bold
'anchor'
\series default
 region (default the entire first molecule) will be centered; all 
\series bold
'fixed'
\series default
 molecules will be imaged only if imaging brings them closer to the 
\series bold
'anchor'
\series default
 molecule (default for 
\series bold
'fixed'
\series default
 molecules is all non-solvent non-ion molecules).
 All other molecules (referred to as 
\series bold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The autoimage command works for the majority of systems; however, for very
 densely packed systems the default anchor (entire first molecule) may not
 be appropriate.
 In these cases, it is recommended to choose as the anchor a small region
 which should lie near the center of your system.
 For example, in a protein dimer system one could choose a single residue
 that is near the center of the interface between the two monomers.

 translation movement prior to this command by using e.g.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout Standard
Usually frame corruption can be detected using only a few atoms, but this
 may not catch all types of corruption.
 The more atoms that are used the better the corruption detection will be,
 but the slower it will be to process the command.
 Typically a good procedure to follow when corruption is suspected is to

 Note that cpptraj expects atom names to correspond to the PDB V3 standard:
 N, CA, C, CB.
 For each residue, the number of frames in which the amino acid is 'L' or
 'D' will be recorded.
 For example, to check the chirality of all amino acids in a system and
 write to a file named chiral.dat with data set name DPDP:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
checkchirality DPDP out chiral.dat

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cluster frames in a trajectory using dihedral angles.
 To define which dihedral angles will be used for clustering either an atom
 mask or an input file specified by the 
\series bold
dihedralfile
\series default
 keyword should be used.
 If dihedral file is used, each line in the file should contain a dihedral
 to be binned with format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
ATOM#1 ATOM#2 ATOM#3 ATOM#4 #BINS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where the ATOM arguments are the atom numbers (starting from 1) defining
 the dihedral and #BINS is the number of bins to be used (so if #BINS=10
 the width of each bin will be 36º).
 If an atom mask is specified, only protein backbone dihedrals (Phi and
 Psi defined using atom names C-N-CA-C and N-CA-C-N) within the mask will
 be used, with the bin sizes specified by the phibins and psibins keywords
 (default for each is 10 bins).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Output will either be written to STDOUT or the file specified by the 
\series bold
out
\series default
 keyword.
 First, information about which dihedrals were clustered will be printed.
 Then the number of clusters will be printed, followed by detailed information
 of each cluster.
 The clusters are sorted from most populated to least populated.
 Each cluster line has format
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Cluster CLUSTERNUM CLUSTERPOP [ dihedral1bin, dihedral2bin ...
 dihedralNbin ]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
followed by a list of frame numbers that belong to that cluster.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If specified by the 
\series bold
clusterinfo

Due to the fact that diffusion is currently calculated from initial positions
 only, diffusion calculated for small numbers of atoms will be inherently

Because this method compares pairs of internal distances and not absolute

 that a no-fit RMSD calculation is.

 The defaults for a non-periodic system are ntb=0, cut=9999.0, igb=1.
 The defaults for a periodic system are ntb=1, cut=8.0, igb=0.
 This currently requires writing a temporary Amber topology, the name of

Cpptraj (and most of Amber) expects that atom indices in molecules to increase
 monotonically.
 However, occasionally atom indices in molecules can become disordered or
 non-sequential, in which case cpptraj will print an error message such
 as the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Error: Atom 45 was assigned a lower molecule # (1) than previous atom (2).

 (GIST) is a method for analyzing the structure and thermodynamics of solvent
 in the vicinity of a solute molecule.
 The current implementation works for only water, but the method can be
 generalized to other solvents whose molecules are rigid like water, such
 as chloroform or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO).
 GIST post-processes explicit solvent simulation data to create a three-dimensio
nal mapping of water density and thermodynamic properties within a region
 of interest, which is defined by a user-specified 3D rectangular grid.
 The small grid boxes are referred to as voxels, and each voxel is associated
 with solvent properties.
 (See Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.) The GIST implementation incorporated into AmberTools 
\emph on
cpptraj
\emph default
 also calculates a number of other local water properties, as listed below.
 GIST works for the nonpolarizable water models currently supported by AMBER.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to carry out a GIST calculation, you must have a trajectory file
 generated with explicit water, as well as the corresponding topology file.
 To generate the most readily interpretable results, it is recommended that
 the solute (e.g., a protein) be restrained into essentially one conformation.
 GIST will then provide information about the structure and thermodynamics
 of the solvent for that conformation.
 For a room-temperature simulation of a solvent-exposed binding site, and
 a grid-spacing of 0.5 Å, it is recommended that the simulation be at least
 10-20 ns in duration, and it is also a good idea to check for convergence
 of the GIST properties you are interested in by loading and then processing
 successively more frames of your trajectory file.
 Because GIST assumes that the solute of interest comprises all molecules
 in the simulation that are not waters, it is a good idea to remove all
 counterions and cosolutes with cpptraj's strip command before running GIST.
 A sample series of cpptraj commands for running GIST is provided below.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that a number of quantities are written out as both densities and normalize
d quantities.
 For example, the output file includes both the solute-water energy density
 and the normalized (per water) solute-water energy.
 In all cases, the normalized quantity at voxel 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i,norm}$
\end_inset

 is related to the corresponding density, 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i,dens}$

\begin_inset Formula $X_{i,norm}=\rho_{i}X_{i,dens}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the number density of water in the voxel.
 The normalized quantity provides information regarding the nature of the
 water found in the voxel.
 The density has the property that, if the grid extended over the entire
 simulation volume, the total system quantity would be given by 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{tot}=V_{voxel}\sum_{i}X_{i,dens}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{voxel}$

Similar grid files with other computed quantities can be generated by reading

 the corresponding dx file.
 The input format, and an example, are as follows:

If the doeij keyword is provided, GIST also writes a large file, Eww_ij.dat,

\begin_inset Formula $j$

 interaction energy (kcal/mole) of water in voxels 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 If the occupancy of either voxel is 0, such as for voxels covered by solute

 In order to save space, such interactions are omitted from the file.

Referencing GIST results to unperturbed (bulk) water
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory, which is the basis of GIST, is designed
 to provide information on how water structure and thermodynamics around
 a solute molecule, such as a protein, are changed relative to the structure
 and thermodynamics of unperturbed (bulk) water.
 Accordingly, the quantities reported by GIST are most informative when
 the results are referenced to the corresponding bulk water properties.
 For the orientational entropy, the reference value is the same regardless
 of water model or conditions, because the first order orientational distributio
n of water in the bulk is always uniform.
 Therefore, the GIST results for orientational entropies are already referenced
 to bulk.
 However, cpptraj reports unreferenced values for those GIST quantities
 whose reference values depend upon the water model and the simulation condition
s; i.e., the energies.
 The translational entropy as well as the number densities will be referenced
 to bulk using the input referenced density or the default density value
 of 0.0334.
 The table below provides useful reference values for these quantities,
 computed for various water models at P=1atm, T=300K, using GIST in order
 to ensure a consistent minimum image treatment of periodic boundary conditions.

Interpreting GIST results
\series default
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GIST provides access to the first order entropies and the first- and second-orde
r energies of inhomogeneous fluid solvation theory.
 Non-zero higher-order entropies exist but are not yet computationally accessibl
e.
 However, for a pairwise additive force-field, such as those listed in the
 Table above, the energy is fully described at the second order provided
 by GIST.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GIST is a research tool, and its applications (to, for example, protein-ligand
 binding and protein function) are still being explored.
 The following general comments may be helpful to users studying GIST results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 The water in voxels near a solute (e.g., a protein) almost always has unfavorable
 water-water interaction energies, relative to bulk, simply because the
 solute displaces water, resulting in fewer proximal water-water interactions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 The unfavorable water-water energies mentioned in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Lazaridis"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 may be balanced by favorable water-solute interactions.
 If they are not, as may occur especially for voxels in small, hydrophobic
 pockets, then the net energy of the water in the voxel may be unfavorable
 relative to bulk, in which case a ligand which displaces water from the
 voxel into bulk may get a boost in affinity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Because the first order orientational distribution of bulk water is uniform,
 and a nonuniform distribution always has lower entropy than a uniform one,
 the solute can only lower the orientational entropy of water, relative
 to bulk.
 Thus, this term always opposes solvation, and displacing oriented water
 into the bulk is always favorable from the standpoint of orientational
 entropy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Localized water, which corresponds to voxels with high water density, has
 a low first order translational entropy, and the translational entropy
 around a solute is lower than that in bulk, as a nonuniform translational
 distribution takes the place of the uniform translational distribution
 of bulk water.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 The displacement of highly oriented (low orientational entropy) and localized
 (low translational entropy) water into bulk leads to a favorable increase
 in these entropy terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 However, highly oriented and localized water is often the consequence of
 strongly favorable polar interactions, such as hydrogen-bonding, between
 water and the solute.
 As a consequence, the net favorability of displacing such water is frequently
 a balance between favorable entropic consequences and unfavorable energetic
 consequences.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 The water-water energy associated with a given voxel accounts for the interacti
ons of the waters in this voxel with all other waters in the system, including
 waters in other voxels.
 This quantity is multiplied by ½, so that, in a pure-water system where
 the GIST grid covers the entire simulation box, the sum over all voxels
 equals the correct mean water-water interaction energy.
 Note that Reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nguyen-gist"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 does not include this factor of ½.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
8.
 For a typical GIST application, in which the grid occupies only part of
 the simulation box, the energy bookkeeping can become complicated, as discussed
 in Section II.B.3 (page 044101-6) of Reference 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nguyen-gist"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 That section also explains how one can compute the water-water energy associate
d with a region 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 defined by a set of voxels, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{WW}^{R}$
\end_inset

.
 The regional water-water energy, on a normalized (per water) basis, is
 given by 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{WW}^{R}=2(\sum_{i\in R}E_{i,WW}-\sum_{i\in R}\sum_{j\in R,j>i}E_{i,j,WW})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in R$
\end_inset

 means that voxel 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is in region 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i,WW}$
\end_inset

 is the value of Eww-norm for voxel 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i,j,WW}$
\end_inset

 is the value of the water-water interaction energy between voxels 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, taken from the file Eww_ij.dat.
 The extra factor of 2 in the present formula, relative to that in the paper,
 results from application of an extra factor of ½ to the reported water-water
 interaction energies here.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Karplus parameter file each parameter set consists of two lines for
 each dihedral with the format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
[<Type>]<Name1><Name2><Name3><Name4><A><B><C>[<D>]
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<Resname1>[<Resname2>...]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first line defines the parameter set for a dihedral.
 <Type> is optional; if not given the form for calculating the J-coupling
 will be as described by Chou et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

; if 'C' the form will be as described by Perez et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Perez01"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 The <NameX> parameters define the four atoms involved in the dihedral.
 Each <NameX> parameter is 5 characters wide, starting with a plus '+',
 minus '-' or space ' ' character indicating the atom belongs to the next,
 previous, or current residue.
 The remaining 4 characters are the atom name.
 The parameters <A>, <B>, <C>, and <D> are floating point values 6 characters
 wide describing the Karplus parameters.
 For the 'C' form A, B, and C correspond to C0, C1, and C2; D is unused
 and should not be specified.
 The second line is a list of residue names (4 characters each) to which
 the dihedral applies.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
C HA   CA   CB   HB    5.40 -1.37  3.61

Output can be in both a fixed format (
\series bold

\series bold

\series default
).
 The fixed format has each dihedral that is defined from 
\series bold

 printed along with its calculated J-coupling value for each frame, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 Base pairing is determined first by base reference axis origin distance,
 then by stagger, then by angle between base Z axes, then finally by hydrogen
 bonding (at least one hydrogen bond must be present).
 Base pair parameters will only be written for determined base pairs.
 Both Watson-Crick and other types of base pairing can be detected.

 contacts as determined by a simple distance cut-off, i.e.
 any atoms which are closer than 
\series bold
<cut>
\series default
 in the specified reference frame (the first frame if no reference specified)
 are considered a native contact.
 If one mask is provided, contacts are looked for within 
\series bold
<mask1>
\series default
; if two masks are provided, only contacts between atoms in 
\series bold
<mask1>
\series default
 and atoms in 
\series bold
<mask2>
\series default
 are looked for (useful for determining intermolecular contacts).
 By default only native contacts are tracked.
 This can be changed by specifying the 
\series bold
savenonnative
\series default
 keyword.
 The time series for contacts can be saved using the 
\series bold
series
\series default
 keyword; these can be further consolidated by residue using the 
\series bold
resseries
\series default
 keyword.
 When using <resseries> the data set index is calculated as (r2 * nres)
 + r1 so that indices can be matched between native/non-native contact pairs.
 Non-native residue contact legends have an nn_ prefix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Native contacts that are found are written to the file specified by writecontact
s (or STDOUT) with format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
# Contact Nframes Frac.
 Avg Stdev 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\family typewriter
Contact
\family default
 takes the form ':<residue1 num>@<atom name>_:<residue2 num>@<atom name>,
 
\family typewriter
Nframes
\family default
 is the number of frames the contact is present, 
\family typewriter
Frac.

\family default
 is the total fraction of frames the contact is present, 
\family typewriter
Avg
\family default
 is the average distance of the contact when present, and 
\family typewriter
Stdev
\family default
 is the standard deviation of the contact distance when present.
 If 
\series bold
resout
\series default
 is specified the total fraction of contacts is printed for all residue
 pairs having native contacts with format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
#Res1 #Res2 TotalFrac Contacts 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\family typewriter
#Res1
\family default
 is the first residue number, 
\family typewriter
#Res2
\family default
 is the second residue number, 
\family typewriter
TotalFrac
\family default
 is the total fraction of contacts for the residue pair, and 
\family typewriter
Contacts
\family default
 is the total number of native contacts involved with the residue pair.
 Since 
\family typewriter
TotalFrac
\family default
 is calculated for each pair as the sum of each contact involving that pair
 divided by the total number of frames, it is possible to have 
\family typewriter
TotalFrac
\family default
 values greater than 1 if the residue pair includes more than 1 native contact.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
During trajectory processing, non-native contacts (i.e.
 any pair satisfying the distance cut-off which is not already a native
 contact) are also searched for.
 The time series for native contacts can be saved as well, with 1 for contact
 present and 0 otherwise (similar to the 
\series bold
\emph on
hbond
\series default
\emph default
 command).
 This data can be subsequently analyzed using e.g.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj-lifetime"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contact maps (matrices) are generated for native and non-native contacts.
 If 
\series bold
byresidue
\series default
 is specified, contact maps are summed over residues, and contacts between
 residues spaced 
\series bold
<resoffset>
\series default
 residues apart in sequence are ignored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\series bold
contactpdb
\series default
 is specified a PDB is generated containing relative contact strengths in
 the B-factor column.
 The relative contact strength is normalized so that a value of 100 means
 that atom participated in the most contacts with other atoms.

\begin_layout Standard
The outtraj command is similar in function to 
\series bold
\emph on
trajout
\series default
\emph default
, and takes all of the same arguments.
 However, instead of writing a trajectory frame after all actions are complete
 outtraj writes the trajectory frame at its position in the Action queue.
 For example, given the input:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajin mdcrd.crd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
trajout output.crd
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rms R1 first :1-20@CA out rmsd.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
outtraj AfterRmsd.crd
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
three trajectories will be written: output.crd, BeforeRmsd.crd, and AfterRmsd.crd.
 The output.crd and AfterRmsd.crd trajectories will be identical, but the
 BeforeRmsd.crd trajectory will contain the coordinates of mdcrd.crd before
 they are RMS-fit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The maxmin keyword can be used to restrict output using one more more data
 sets.
 For example, to only write frames for which the RMSD value is between 0.7
 and 0.8:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code

 To convert a standard density in g
\begin_inset space ~

Note that correct normalization of the RDF depends on the number of atoms
 in each mask; if multiple topology files are being processed that result
 in changes in the number of atoms in each mask, the normalization will
 be off.

Per-residue RMSD calculation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the 
\series bold
\color black
perres
\series default
\color inherit
 keyword is specified, after the initial RMSD calculation the no-fit RMSD
 of specified residues is also calculated.
 So for example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rmsd :10-260 reference perres perresout PRMS.dat range 190-211 perresmask
 &!(@H=)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\family roman
will first perform a best-fit RMSD calculation to the first specified reference
 structure using residues 10 to 260, then calculate the no-fit RMSD of residues
 190 to 211 (excluding any hydrogen atoms), writing the results to PRMS.dat.
 Two additional recommendations for the 'perres' option: 1) try not including
 backbone atoms by using the 'perresmask' keyword, e.g.
 "perresmask &!@H,N,CA,HA,C,O", and 2) try using the 'perrescenter' keyword,
 which centers each residue prior to the 'nofit' calculation; this is useful
 for isolating changes in residue conformation.

Cpptraj supports writing out vector data in a pseudo-trajectory format for
 easy visualization.
 Once a vector data set has been generated the writedata command can be
 used with the vectraj keyword (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Datafile-Commands"

\end_inset

 for more details) to write a pseudo trajectory consisting of two atoms,
 one for the vector origin and one for the vector from the origin (i.e.
 V+O).
 For example, to create a MOL2 containing a pseudo-trajectory of the minimum-ima
ged vector from residue 4 to residue 11:

 Pseudo-velocities are calculated using coordinates and the specified time
 step.
 As with all time correlation functions the statistical noise will increase
 if the maximum lag is greater than half the total number of frames.
 In addition to calculating the velocity autocorrelation function, the self-diff
usion coefficient will be reported in the output, calculated from the integral
 over the VAC function.

 Unlike 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
Like Actions, when an Analysis command is issued it is by default added

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Clustering Metrics
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) measures sum over all clusters of the within
 cluster scatter to the between cluster separation; 
\series bold
the smaller the DBI, the better
\series default
.
 The DBI is defined as the average, for all clusters X, of fred, where fred(X)
 = max, across other clusters Y, of (Cx + Cy)/dXY.
 Here Cx is the average distance from points in X to the centroid, similarly
 Cy, and dXY is the distance between cluster centroids.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pseudo-F statistic (pSF) is another measure of clustering goodness.
 It is intended to capture the 'tightness' of clusters, and is in essence
 a ratio of the mean sum of squares between groups to the mean sum of squares
 within group.
 
\series bold
High values are good
\series default
.
 Generally, one selects a cluster-count that gives a peak in the pseudo-f
 statistic.
 Formula: A/B, where A = (T - P)/(G-1), and B = P / (n-G).
 Here n is the number of points, G is the number of clusters, T is the total
 distance from the all-data centroid, and P is the sum (for all clusters)
 of the distances from the cluster centroid.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cluster silhouette is a measure of how well each point fits within a
 cluster.
 Values of 1 indicate the point is very similar to other points in the cluster,
 i.e.
 it is well-clustered.
 Values of -1 indicate the point is dissimilar and may fit better in a neighbori
ng cluster.
 Values of 0 indicate the point is on a border between two clusters.

Hints for setting DBSCAN parameters with 'kdist'
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:cpptraj_dbscan_Hints"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is not always obvious what parameters to set for DBSCAN.
 You can get a rough idea of what to set 'mindist' and 'epsilon' to by generatin
g a so-called "K-dist" plot with the 'kidst <k>' option.
 The K-dist plot shows for each point (X axis) the Kth farthest distance
 (Y axis), sorted by decreasing distance.
 You supply the same distance metric and sieve parameters you want to use
 for the actual clustering, but nothing else.
 For example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
cluster C0 dbscan kdist 4 rms :1-4@CA sieve 10 loadpairdist pairdist CpptrajPair
Dist
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The K-dist plot will be named <prefix>.<k>.dat, with the default prefix being
 'Kdist' (in this case the file name would be Kdist.4.dat).
 The K-dist plot usually looks like a curve with an initially steep slope
 that gradually decreases.
 Around where the initial part of the curve starts to flatten out (indicating
 an increas in density) is around where epsilon should be set; minpoints
 is set to whatever <k> was.
 It has been suggested that the shape of the K-dist curve doesn't change
 too much after Kdist=4, but users are encouraged to experiment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Using 'dpeaks' clustering
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 'dpeaks' (density peaks) algorithm attempts to find clusters by identifying
 points in high density regions which are far from other points of high
 density
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Rodriguez2014"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 There are two ways these points can be chosen.
 The first and recommended way is manually.
 In this method, clustering if first run with 
\series bold
choosepoints
\series default
 not specified to generate a plot containing density versus minimum distance
 to point with next highest density (the decision graph).
 Appropriate cut offs for distance and density can then be chosen based
 on visual inspection; cutoffs should be chosen so that they select points
 that have both a high density and a high distance to point with next highest
 density.
 Clustering can then be run again with 
\series bold
distancecut
\series default
 and 
\series bold
densitycut
\series default
 set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second way is automatically; cpptraj will attempt to identify outliers
 in the density vs distance plot based on distance from the running average.
 Although this only requires a single pass, this method of choosing points
 is not well-tested and currently not recommended.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
The CpptrajPairDist file format
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The CpptrajPairDist file is binary; the exact format depends on what version
 of cpptraj generated the file (since earlier versions had no concept of
 'sieve').
 The CpptrajPairDist file starts with a 4 byte header containing the characters
 'C' 'T' 'M' followed by the version number.
 A quick way to figure out the version is to use the linux 'od' command
 to output the first 4 bytes as hexadecimal, e.g.:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
$ od -t x1 -N 4 CpptrajPairDist 0000000 43 54 4d 02
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the CpptrajPairDist file version in the above example is 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next few numbers describe the matrix size and depend on the version.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Version
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

0: Two 4-byte integers: # of rows and # of elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Version
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

1: Two 8-byte unsigned integers (equivalent to size_t on most systems):
 # of rows and # of elements.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Description
Version
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

2: Three 8 byte unsigned integers: original # of rows, actual # of rows,
 and sieve value.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is followed by the actual matrix data, stored as a single array of
 floats (4 bytes).
 For versions 1 and 2 the number of elements is explicitly stored.
 For version 2, to calculate the number of matrix elements you need to read:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Elements = (actual_rows * (actual_rows - 1)) / 2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cluster pair-distance matrix is an upper-right triangle matrix without
 the diagonal (in row-major order), so the first element is the distance
 between elements 0 and 1, the second is between elements 0 and 2, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In version 2 files, if the sieve value is greater than 1 that means original_row
s > actual_rows and there is an additional array of characters original_nrows
 long, with 'T' if the row is being ignored (i.e.
 it was sieved out) and 'F' if the row is active (i.e.
 is active in the actual pairwise-distance matrix).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The code that cpptraj uses to read in CpptrajPairDist files is in ClusterMatrix:
:LoadFile() (ClusterMatrix.cpp).

 contain constants for curve fitting termed AX (with X being a numerical
 digit, one for each constant), and is assigned to a variable which then
 becomes a data set.

\begin_layout Standard
Calculate eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the specified symmetric matrix.
 This is followed by Principal Component Analysis (in cartesian coordinate
 space in the case of a covariance matrix or in distance space in the case
 of a distance-covariance matrix), or Quasiharmonic Analysis (in the case
 of a mass-weighted covariance matrix).
 Diagonalization of distance, correlation, idea, and ired matrices are also
 possible.
 Eigenvalues are given in cm

 In the case of a mass-weighted covariance matrix, the eigenvectors are
 mass-weighted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For quasi-harmonic analysis the input must be a mass-weighted covariance
 matrix.
 Thermodynamic quantities are calculated based on statistical mechanical
 formulae that assume the input system is oscillating in a single energy

Note that the maximum number of non-zero eigenvalues obtainable depends
 on the number of frames used to generate the input matrix; the number of
 frames should be equal to or greater than the number of columns in the
 matrix in order to obtain all eigenmodes.
\end_layout

Results may include average coordinates (in the case of covar, mwcovar,
 correl), average distances (in the case of distcovar), main diagonal elements
 (in the case of idea and ired), eigenvalues, and eigenvectors.

\series bold

\begin_layout Description
<setname>[name] Name of each set.
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
Perform lifetime analysis for specified data sets.
 Lifetime data can either be determined for the entire set, or for time
 windows of specified size within the set if 
\series bold
window
\series default
 specified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lifetime
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is defined as the length of time something remains 'present'; data is considere
d present when above or below a certain cutoff (the default is greater than
 0.5, useful for analysis of 
\series bold
\shape italic
hbond
\series default
\shape default
 time series data).
 For example, in the case of a hydrogen bond 
\series bold
'series'
\series default
 data set, if a hydrogen bond is present during a frame the value is 1,
 otherwise it is 0.
 Given the hbond time series data set {1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1}, the overall
 fraction present is 0.6.
 However, there are 3 lifetimes of lengths 3, 1, and 2 ({1 1 1}, {1}, and
 {1 1}).
 The maximum lifetime is 3 and the average lifetime is 2.0, i.e.
 (3 + 1 + 2) / 3 lifetimes = 2.0.
 One can also construct a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lifetime curve
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is constructed as the sum of all individual lifetimes.
 By default these curves are normalized to 1.0, but the raw curve can be
 obtained using the 
\series bold
rawcurve
\series default
 keyword.
 For the example data set here the raw lifetime curve would be 3 frames
 long:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
       1 1 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
       1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
       1 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
Curve: 3 2 1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By default data sets are sorted by name unless 
\series bold
nosort
\series default
 is specified.
 The lifetime command can calculate lifetimes over specific time windows
 by using the 
\series bold
window
\series default
 keyword.
 This can be particularly useful if one wants to get a sense for how lifetimes
 are changing over the course of very long time series data.
 In addition, averages can be calculated instead of lifetimes by specifying
 
\series bold
averageonly
\series default
.
 Cumulative averages over windows can be obtained using the 
\series bold
cumulative
\series default
 keyword, or the change from the average value in the previous window can
 be obtained using the 
\series bold
delta
\series default
 keyword.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\series bold
fuzz
\series default
 keyword can be used to try and smooth the input data by ignoring changes
 in state that occur for fewer frames than <fuzzcut>.
 For example, in the above example hbond time series data set there is a
 one frame change in state between the first and second lifetimes which
 could be interpreted as a transient breaking of the hydrogen bond.
 Using a <fuzzcut> value of 1, this one frame change in state would be ignored,
 and the data set would effectively appear to lifetime as {1 1 1 1 1 0 0
 0 1 1}.
 The state change between the second and third lifetimes is longer than
 <fuzzcut> (3 frames) and so it would remain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\series bold
window
\series default

<setname>[frames]
\family default
 denotes the total number of frames present in all lifetimes, and 
\family typewriter
<setname>[name] 
\family default
is the data set name.
 The file crv.<filename> contains the lifetime curves for each set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\series bold
window
\series default
 is specified, four files are output: <filename>, max.<filename>, avg.<filename>,
 and crv.<filename>.
 <filename> contains the fraction 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 over each time window for each set, max.<filename> contains the maximum
 lifetime in each time window for each set, avg.<filename> contains the average

 overall lifetime curves for each set.
 For window output, Gnuplot format is recommended.

The RMS average correlation
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

\end_inset

 (RAC) is calculated as the average RMSD of running-averaged coordinates
 over increasing window sizes (or lag).
 Output has format:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
<WindowSize> <RAC>
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first entry has a window size of 1, and so is just the average RMSD
 of all frames to the specified reference structure.
 The second entry has a window size of two, so it is the average RMSD of
 all frames averaged over two adjacent windows to the specified reference,
 and so on.
 The RAC will be calculated up to the number of frames minus 1 or the value
 specified by 
\series bold
stop
\series default
, whichever is lower.
 The offset can be used to speed up the calculation by skipping window sizes.
 To calculate mass-weighted RMSD specify 
\series bold
mass
\series default
.
 Note that to reduce memory costs it can be useful to strip all coordinates
 not involved in the RMS fit from the system prior to specifying 'rmsavgcorr'.
 For example, to calculate the correlation of C-alpha RMSD of residues 2
 to 12:
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
strip !(:2-12@CA)
\end_layout

\begin_layout LyX-Code
rmsavgcorr out rmscorr.dat
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The curve generated by RAC decays towards zero due to the way RAC is defined.
 By the time the "lag" is N-1 (where N is the total number of frames) you
 have only two averaged coordinates: call them Avg1 (averaged over 1 though
 N-1 frames) and Avg2 (averaged over 2 through N frames).
 Barring any extraordinary circumstances the RMSD between Avg1 and Avg2
 will almost certainly be quite low.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The RAC is a way to probe the time scales of interesting events.
 Any deviation from a smoothly decaying curve is an indication that there
 are some significant structural differences occurring over that time interval.
 RAC curves can be particularly useful when comparing independent simulations
 of the same system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One thing to keep in mind that since the underlying metric is RMSD, it can
 be sensitive to the reference frame you choose.
 It may be useful to try looking at both RAC from the first frame, as well
 as an averaged reference frame.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Briefly, random vectors (representing the orientation of the molecule)
 are rotated according to rotation matrices obtained from an RMS fit to
 a reference structure (typically an averaged structure).
 For each random vector the time correlation function of the rotated vector
 is calculated using Legendre polynomials of the specified order.
 The integral over this time correlation function (which may be smoothed
 using cubic splines to improve the integration) is then used to find the
 effective diffusion constant (D) in the limit of small anisotropy.
 Then, using each calculated D, the diffusion tensor is determined with
 full anisotropy.
 Finally, a downhill simplex minimizer is used to optimize D with full anisotrop
y; (this last step is not described in the original paper).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rotation matrices are generated via an RMS fit to a reference structure
 (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj-rmsd"

\end_inset

).
 It is recommended that the RMS fit be done to an average structure (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "subsec:cpptraj-average"

\end_inset

).
 These rotation matrices are used to rotate each random vector M times (where
 M is the total number of frames), which creates a time series for each
 random vector.
 The time correlation functions are calculated for each random vector time
 series using Legendre polynomials of the specified order (default 2).
 The maximum length of the correlation function (or lag) can be specified
 by 
\series bold
ncorr
\series default
 (in frames).
 If 
\series bold
ncorr
\series default
 is not specified it will be set internally based on the specified values
 of 
\series bold
ti
\series default
, 
\series bold
tf
\series default
, and 
\series bold
dt
\series default
; this is recommended.
 Note that if 
\series bold
ncorr
\series default
 is specified it should be set to a number less than the total number of
 frames since noise in time correlation functions increases as 
\series bold
ncorr
\series default
 approaches the # of frames.
 The integration over the correlation function is from 
\series bold
ti 
\series default
(in whatever units are used of 
\series bold
dt
\series default
, generally ns; 0.0 ns if not specified) to 
\series bold
tf
\series default
 (same units as

Example
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are two important things to keep in mind when using rotdif analysis:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
When calculating any kind of diffusive property it is best to simulate in
 the microcanonical (NVE) ensemble with a shorter time step and increased
 SHAKE tolerance; thermostats and barostats will effect diffusion calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Time correlation functions become noisier as the length of the function
 approaches the maximum.
 Therefore in general one should choose parameters for the time correlation
 function that are much shorter than the total simulation length.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For example, given a trajectory 'mdcrd.nc' containing 10000 frames with a

 generated via an RMS fit to 'avgstruct.pdb', computing and integrating the

 simulation), and writing out the effective diffusion constants and results

 The created Wavelet map provides a clear picture of the significant motions

 Note that typically the trajectory in question should have rotational and
 translational movement removed (via e.g.

Wavelet analysis contains two main steps which performs continues wavelet
 transform (CWT) and statistical significance testing as proposed by Torrence
 and Compo
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Torrence1998"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Analysis is executed on one dimensional (1-D) coordinate which is defined
 as the displacement from the starting position.
 For each atom, CWT is calculated over a specified range of scales from
 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}$
\end_inset

up to 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{0}2^{(nb-1)ds}$
\end_inset

.
 To obtain the CWT of the trajectory the Fourier transform of atom's displacemen
t and wavelets which scaled by S ( S is calculated from: 
\begin_inset Formula $S=S_{0}2^{jds};\:j=0,1,2,\ldots,nb-1$
\end_inset

) is computed and then the inverse Fourier transform of the product of Fourier
 transforms will be calculated as the CWT.
 After calculating the wavelet coordinates for all atoms, a significance
 testing is performed to determine the significance of each wavelet coordinate.
 For doing this test we need to have an appropriate background spectrum
 to consider as a mean or expected spectrum and compare our wavelet coordinates
 against this background.
 In order to calculate the background spectrum since wavelet spectrum (according
 to the convolution theorem) follows the Fourier spectrum, the Fourier coefficie
nts over every atom's displacement is calculated using the following formula
 and a model (
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{k}$
\end_inset

) is constructed on average which Fourier coefficients fit (
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

) is the time series which is the atom’s displacement and k is the frequency
 index

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This test is implemented based on the null hypothesis that the assumption
 is that Fourier coordinates normally distributed around the expected value,
 then the wavelet coordinates should also be normally distributed.
 Assuming the expected background spectrum and since the square of a normally
 distributed variable is chi-square distributed, then the distribution for
 the square of the absolute values of wavelet coordinates (
\begin_inset Formula $|W_{i,k}|^{2}$
\end_inset

 is as follows (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

is the variance of the atom's displacement).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sigma^{2}\mu_{k}\chi_{2}^{2}/2

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then choosing a confidence level we can determine the minimum acceptable
 value for 
\begin_inset Formula $|W_{i,k}|^{2}$
\end_inset

to be considered as a significant coordinates at that certain confidence
 level.
 In the final map the scales of only those wavelet coordinates which are
 significantly above the expected distribution are stored.
