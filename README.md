CPPTRAJ
=======

CPPTRAJ is a program designed to load and analyze molecular dynamics
trajectories and relevant data sets derived from their analysis. It is 
a C++ rewrite of the PTRAJ trajectory analysis code from Amber.

*Note that the GitHub version of CPPTRAJ should be considered BETA.*  
The official AmberTools release version of CPPTRAJ can be found
at the [Amber website](http://ambermd.org).

Installation & Testing
======================
Run `./configure --help` for a short list of configure options. `./configure --full-help`
will list all available configure options. By default, CPPTRAJ requires the following
libraries:

* NetCDF
* BLAS
* LAPACK
* ARPACK
* Bzip2
* Gzip

`./configure gnu` should be adequate to set up compilation for most systems.
For systems without BLAS/LAPACK/ARPACK and/or NETCDF libraries installed,
the `-amberlib` flag can be specified to use the ones already compiled in
an AmberTools installation (`$AMBERHOME` must be set), e.g.
`./configure -amberlib gnu`. For multicore systems, the `-openmp` flag can
be specified to enable OpenMP parallelization, e.g. `./configure -openmp gnu`.
An MPI-parallelized version of CPPTRAJ can also be built using the `-mpi` flag;
currently MPI can only be used for `ensemble` processing (see the manual for
further details).

The configure script by default sets everything up to link dynamically. The
`-static` flag can be used to force static linking. If linking errors are
encountered you may need to specify library locations using the `--with-LIB=`
options. For example, to use NetCDF compiled in `/opt/netcdf` use the option 
`--with-netcdf=/opt/netcdf`. Alternatively, individual libraries can be 
disabled with the `-no<LIB>` options.

After `configure` has been successfully run, `make install` will
compile and place the cpptraj binary in the `bin/` subdirectory. It is highly
recommended that `make check` be run as well to test the basic functionality
of CPPTRAJ.

  CPPTRAJ is based on PTRAJ by Thomas E. Cheatham, III (University of Utah,
Salt Lake City, UT, USA) and many routines from PTRAJ have been adapted for 
use in CPPTRAJ, including code used in the following classes:
Analysis\_CrankShaft, Analysis\_Statistics, Action\_DNAionTracker,
Action\_RandomizeIons, Action\_Principal, Action\_Grid, GridAction,
Action\_Image, and ImageRoutines.

Documentation
=============
  The main documentation for CPPTRAJ usage is in the AmberTools user manual,
available from the [Amber website](http://ambermd.org/doc12/) or from the AmberTools
distribution in `$AMBERHOME/doc`. There is also limited help for commands in interactive mode via
`help [<command>]`; `help` with no arguments lists all known commands.

  Code documentation can be generated via Doxygen by typing `make docs`. This
will install HTML and Latex documentation at `doc/html/index.html` and in 
the `doc/latex` respectively. A limited developers guide is available in
Lyx/PDF formats in the `doc/` subdirectory.
