// Class: Action 
/// The abstract base class that all other actions inherit. 
/** By convention actions have 3 main phases: Init, Setup, and DoAction.
  * Init is used to initialize the action, make sure that all arguments
  * for the action are correct, and add any DataSets/DataFiles which will
  * be used by the action. Setup will set up the action for a specific
  * Topology file. DoAction will perform the action on a given frame.
  * A fourth function, Print, is for any additional calculations or output 
  * the action may require once all frames are processed.
  * Note that Setup and DoAction take Topology and Frame pointer addresses 
  * respectively as their final arguments; this allows actions to modify
  * the current Topology/Frame by replacing them with ones inside the Action
  * itself. This is more memory-hungry but allows the Topology/Frame to be
  * manipulated quickly, and is also easier to return to the original
  * Topology/Frame via USEORIGINALFRAME (see e.g. Action_Unstrip in 
  * Action_Strip.cpp).
